# sales-report_excel-project
This is sales report of a particular store which basically deals in clothing. I used Ms-Excel to work on this project and adopted several steps in report creation.
Firstly I had done Data Cleaning and removed the unwanted rows, removed the duplicate values.
Then comes Data Processing. I further created the required columns namely the Age group which was derived from the Age column and also the Month from Date column and organised the data effectively.
Then I did Data Analysis and examined the sales report and extract insights from it. Filtered the data to focus on specific segment. I also used Pivot tables, vLookups to summarize and analyze the sales data.
Then comes Data Visualization. Visual representations can help stakeholders quickly grasp trends and insights from sales data. I create charts (e.g., column charts, line charts) to visually represent sales trends, comparisons, and distributions of data.
I uncovered insights that drive strategic decisions and improvements in the business operations.
